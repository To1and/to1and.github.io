## Motivation

### What is your dataset?
Our main dataset is called MovieLens Dataset (consists of movies released on or before July 2017). It's 33 MB, including 45572 rows (That is to say, it includes data for a total of 45,572 movies), 24 variables. We also introduce several other related dataset like rating, keywords and credits for reference. The total size of all data is approximately 900 MB.


### Why did you choose this/these particular dataset(s)?
Analyzing this dataset is a strategic choice for understanding the intricate relationship between movie elements and financial performance. It offers a comprehensive view of various factors that influence a movie's financial outcomes, such as genres, budgets, revenues, and ratings.

Firstly, the dataset contains a wealth of information, including genres, budgets, and revenue figures, providing insights into the economic dynamics of the film industry. By examining these elements, we can uncover patterns like which genres are more profitable, the relationship between production budgets and box office success, and how ratings influence audience preferences.

Moreover, the inclusion of production companies, countries, and release dates enables us to analyze trends over time and understand the evolving landscape of the movie industry. This temporal analysis helps identify shifts like the impact of streaming platforms and changing audience tastes, offering valuable insights for forecasting future trends.

In summary, this dataset provides a rich foundation for data-driven decision-making. By exploring the relationships between different movie elements and financial performance, stakeholders can make informed choices on budgeting, genre focus, and marketing strategies to navigate the ever-changing film industry landscape effectively.

## Basic stats

### Write about your choices in data cleaning and preprocessing
First, we should take a look at our dataset and find out what are we interested in, what is worth analyzing, and what do we not need.

We can see that our main dataset contains 24 columns, which are listed below:

1. **adult** (`object`): Indicates whether the movie is intended for adults (e.g., `False`).
2. **belongs_to_collection** (`object`): Contains information about the movie's collection if it belongs to one, in JSON-like format (e.g., `{'id': 10194, 'name': 'Toy Story Collection'}`).
3. **budget** (`object`): The production budget of the movie, stored as a string due to mixed data types (e.g., `30000000`).
4. **genres** (`object`): List of genres for the movie in JSON-like format (e.g., `"[{'id': 18, 'name': 'Drama'}, {'id': 10749, 'name': 'Romance'}]"`).
5. **homepage** (`object`): The movie's official website (e.g., `http://toystory.disney.com/toy-story`).
6. **id** (`object`): Unique identifier for the movie (e.g., `862`).
7. **imdb_id** (`object`): The movie's IMDb identifier (e.g., `tt0114709`).
8. **original_language** (`object`): ISO 639-1 code for the original language of the movie (e.g., `en` for English).
9. **original_title** (`object`): The original title of the movie (e.g., `Toy Story`).
10. **overview** (`object`): A brief synopsis or summary of the movie (e.g., `Led by Woody, Andy's toys live happily...`).
11. **popularity** (`object`): Popularity score as a string due to mixed data types (e.g., `21.946943`).
12. **poster_path** (`object`): Path to the movie's poster image (e.g., `/rhIRbceoE9lR4veEXuwCC2wARtG.jpg`).
13. **production_companies** (`object`): List of production companies in JSON-like format (e.g., `"[{'name': 'Pixar Animation Studios', 'id': 3}]"`).
14. **production_countries** (`object`): List of production countries in JSON-like format (e.g., `"[{'iso_3166_1': 'US', 'name': 'United States of America'}]"`).
15. **release_date** (`object`): Release date of the movie (e.g., `1995-10-30`).
16. **revenue** (`float64`): Box office revenue generated by the movie (e.g., `373554033.0`).
17. **runtime** (`float64`): Duration of the movie in minutes (e.g., `81.0`).
18. **spoken_languages** (`object`): List of spoken languages in JSON-like format (e.g., `"[{'iso_639_1': 'en', 'name': 'English'}]"`).
19. **status** (`object`): Current status of the movie (e.g., `Released`).
20. **tagline** (`object`): A tagline or catchphrase for the movie (e.g., `Just When His World Is Back To Normal...`).
21. **title** (`object`): The title of the movie (e.g., `Toy Story`).
22. **video** (`object`): Indicates if there is a related video (e.g., `False`).
23. **vote_average** (`float64`): Average user rating for the movie (e.g., `7.7`).
24. **vote_count** (`float64`): Number of votes the movie received (e.g., `5415.0`).

It's obvious that some of them are pretty useless to us and let us start by removing these features. There are a lot of things we don't care about in our dataset, such as whether or not it's adult content (and the fact that very few films are labelled as such).

We then need to consider a number of issues, for the main objective we are looking at, we need to filter out non-zero values to ensure that the data makes sense.

As we can see, we have over 5,000 rows of data with non-null or zero revenue and budget. This may not seem like a large sample size, about 10% of our entire dataset, but it's enough for us to do some analysis.

Next, we are going to consider adding a new quantity for the ratio of box office to cost. This coefficient we use to measure the success of a film in terms of commercial returns. We call it return_rate.

## Data Analysis & Visualizations

### A glance at title and overview

Do certain words appear more frequently in movie titles and descriptions? It seems likely that some words are deemed more impactful and suitable for a title. Let's investigate this further!

The word **Man** and **Day** tops the list of most frequently used words in movie titles, followed by **Night**, **Love**, and **MOvie**. This trend underscores the pervasive theme of daily life in movies.

We can see **Life** and **Find** are popular in Movie Blurbs. Together with **World**, **Family** and **Love**, these wordclouds give us a pretty good idea of the most popular themes present in movies. 

#### What kind of title could be more profitable?

Above is just a summary of the overall data. Now we're moving on to a more interesting part. To intuitively reflect the possible relationship between movie financial performance and titles, we will weight each word in the movie title by its cost and create a new chart like this.

Surprisingly, possibly contrary to the real world, **man** and **men** spent more money if they appear in a movie title. 

And accordingly **man** also makes a lot of money along with the word **star**. I think this makes sense, given that Star Wars is an extremely successful series with many installments. 

As for the return rate, aside from **man** and **star**, it's hard not to notice the words **Harry** and **Potter**, as very few other movies would include these two words. This further confirms the immense commercial success of Harry Potter, which could be one of the most successful movie series in history. Is that the case? Please be patient, we'll reveal more to you later..

Then we are about to talk about the overview of movie. What kind of plot or theme is more appealing? What kind of theme might lead to a movie's failure? Let's explore that now.

In terms of the overview, we can clearly see the words **world** and **man**, which might indicate that most high-budget movies are filmed with a grand theme or focus on a specific character. 

The same applies to movies with high box office revenue, but from the other two words **new** and **life**, we can also recognize that audiences are more looking forward to new things and life-related themes.

The return on investment also shows us that grand perspective, novelty, and life story are likely essential elements in making a movie more successful according to the same three words.

### Which country makes most profitable Movies?

Unsurprisingly, the majority of movies in our existing data are produced in the United States and speaking english, nearly 80% of our total data. But are American movies definitely the most profitable? Which country's movies have the highest cost-effectiveness and returns? We will explore this next.

![png](assets\images\output_36_0.png)
    


We can see that even though the United States produces the most films, their average production cost is still not the highest. 

The average cost of making a film in Australia is about $9.5 million, and the revenue is about $20.5 million, making it the country with the highest film production costs in the world. 

In contrast, the United States has the highest average revenue per film worldwide, with an average revenue of $22.52 million per film and an average production cost of about $8.14 million. This might be a little-known fact because Australia's film industry isn't very well-known.

### What is the most successful Franchise?

    
![png](assets\images\output_40_0.png)
    


Among the top 10 movie collections by revenue, the **Harry Potter Collection** stands out as the highest-grossing franchise, amassing an impressive total revenue of $7.71 billion across 8 movies, averaging $963.4 million per film. On the other end of the spectrum, the **Jurassic Park Collection** ranks as the lowest-grossing among the top 10, generating $3.03 billion from 4 movies, with an average revenue of $757.9 million per film.

Notably, the **James Bond Collection** is the most prolific, with 26 movies contributing to a significant total revenue of $7.11 billion. Despite this vast output, the collection's average revenue per movie sits at a comparatively modest $273.3 million.


Among these film franchises, when comparing the average revenue per film, The **Avengers Collection** tops the list with a staggering average of $1.4625 billion per film, showcasing its extraordinary global appeal. In contrast, the **Transformers Collection** series ranks at the bottom with an average revenue of $873.22 million per film, still a respectable performance despite being at the lower end. 

Other notable franchises include **Avatar Collection** and **Finding Nemo Collection**, both maintaining strong average revenues. It's worth noting that despite both containing eight films, the **Harry Potter Collection** and **Star Wars Collection** franchises still boast average revenues of over $900 million, further cementing their enduring appeal among audiences.

In terms of production budgets, the **Pirates of the Caribbean Collection** claims the title of the most lavish, with an average budget of $250 million per movie across 5 films, culminating in a total budget of $1.25 billion. Meanwhile, the **James Bond Collection** showcases efficiency, maintaining an average budget of just $59.2 million per movie across its 26-film lineup, resulting in a total production budget of $1.54 billion.

The collection with the largest overall budget is, unsurprisingly, the **James Bond Collection**, with a cumulative production cost of $1.54 billion. In contrast, the **Mission: Impossible Collection** operates with a more conservative budget, totaling $650 million across 5 movies.


### What's the most profitable genre?

When it comes to movie genres, everyone has different preferences. But we wanted to do some analysis to find a relationship between the genre of movies and their commercial success.

Let’s first take a look at the proportion distribution of all movie genre in our data set.

### Do votes matter?

Although we may already know that a commercially successful film will not necessarily receive higher ratings from audiences, and vice versa. But we still want to thoroughly explore how much connection a movie's score has with its commercial success?

![png](assets\images\output_58_0.png)
    

![png](assets\images\output_59_0.png)

    
![png](assets\images\output_60_0.png)
    


In all of the above graphs, we can generally find that costs and benefits do not show a positive or negative correlation with ratings, and that the vast majority of films fall within a range of about four to eight. In the graph about returns we can again recognise that the vast majority of more commercially successful films do not receive a lower rating, but very high ratings do not imply extremely high returns either. This could mean that the most commercially acceptable films are more likely to have a higher return on investment, in short, a film that makes money is not necessarily of high artistic merit.

At this point, we can try to filter out the film entries with less than 1000 votes and graph them again to see how the relatively more famous films perform


![png](assets\images\output_62_0.png)
    

![png](assets\images\output_63_0.png)


    
![png](assets\images\output_64_0.png)
    


Here, we can see that even among relatively famous films, costs and benefits do not have any direct correlation with ratings, which is a very intuitive conclusion for us.



According to our observations, suppose we take films with ratings greater than 7.5 as so-called great films and analyse them, what would happen?


    
![png](assets\images\output_67_0.png)
   
![png](assets\images\output_68_0.png)
    

    
![png](assets\images\output_69_0.png)
    


The graphs reveal that while high-rated movies generally have budgets and revenues clustered in lower ranges, a select few with ratings above 8.0 don't show significantly higher budgets and revenues. Overall, it's obviously not true that movies with higher ratings tend to have proportionally higher budgets and revenues, which suggests that we can't simply make a direct link between a film's financial figures and its artistic success or failure.The vast majority of high-scoring films will have returns concentrated within the 0 to 5 range.

### Are films more profitable now than they once were?

Let me start by looking at the trends in film revenues and costs over time

![png](assets\images\output_74_0.png)
    


It is quite common sense to see that the costs and revenues of the film industry are gradually increasing as time changes. But what about the profitability of films?

    
![png](assets\images\output_76_0.png)
 

In fact, we would be very surprised to find that after the 1960s, when the film industry was gradually maturing, the return on investment for films did not change much, and even fell overall in recent years.
